{"id":"aime24-0","problem":"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.","reference_solution":"Let  $w,x,y,z$  denote the number of residents who own 1,2,3 and 4 of these items, respectively. We know  $w+x+y+z=900$ , since there are 900 residents in total. This simplifies to $w+z=229$ , since we know  $x=437$  and  $y=234$ . Now, we set an equation of the total number of items. We know there are 195 rings, 367 clubs, 562 spades, and 900 candy hearts. Adding these up, there are 2024 (wow! the year!) items in total. Thus,  $w+2x+3y+4z=2024$  since we are adding the number of items each group of people contributes, and this must be equal to the total number of items. Plugging in x and y once more, we get  $w+4z=448$ . Solving  $w+z=229$  and  $w+4z=448$ , we get  $z=\\boxed{073}$  \n-Westwoodmonster","expected_answer":"73","source":"aime24"}
